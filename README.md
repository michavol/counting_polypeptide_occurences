# counting_peptide_occurences

This program counts the number of occurences of n-peptides in given proteins.
People who know about biology can probably do some cool stuff with it.

I also added a main.ipynb - this is a python notebook. These are great for debugging python programs
because you can run individual codeblocks seperately. The easiest way to open and edit them is installing
Anaconda. It is an environment manager for several IDEs (software that makes writing code easier). There
you can easily install Jupyter Notebook with which you can work on python notebooks.

(Here should be a description how to use the code but I am too lazy right now)
